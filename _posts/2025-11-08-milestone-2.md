## Introduction: How to Predict a Goal? 

Following the NHL data exploration of *Milestone 1*, we now dive deeper into the task of estimating the **quality of shots**. For this, we calculate the likelihood of  shot resulting in a goal (**Expected Goals**) based on available features, e.g. *shot type*, *distance*, *angle*, etc. others. This exercise consists of six steps:

- Step 1 introduces a first round of **feature engineering (I)** to prepare the dataset for linear regression models.  
- Step 2 runs initial tests with **linear regression**.  
- Step 3 presents a second round of **feature engineering (II)** to create advanced features for future models.  
- Step 4 tries different **hyperparameter tuning** and **feature selection** methods to determine the best parameters and features, and trains three **XGBoost** models (see Figures 4.1…). 
- Step 5 proposes the **best model** based on previous experiments.  
- Step 6 presents the **test results**.

All experiments and the most relevant models are logged on our [Weights & Biases page](https://wandb.ai/IFT6758_team4/milestone_2).
